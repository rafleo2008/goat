----- Pois dissagregate polygons function ------
-- Calls a subset from planet_osm_polygons and look for doors or intersections with pedestrian or service roads, in case of no gates or intersections, It will return the centroid of the polygon.
-- This new points will be assigned to a specific amenity (input) and injected into pois database.
-- Input values
-- 	subset	: Name of the subset to be used
--  myamenity: category of the amenity to be assigned to these new points
